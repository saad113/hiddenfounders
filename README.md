update infos in the config.php for connection
actual config is:

username: root
password: <empty>

bd name : hidden
sql export of the db in th folder DB
made on wampserver 3.1.3

things that are not fixed:
-the user can like and "item" more than one time and it's added to the liked page.
-the Apostrophe (') and special symbols are not escaped and cannot be added to the mysql db.
 
that's about all, thank you for reviewing this code, and feel free to contact me for any question.
