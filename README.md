update infos in the config.php for connection
actual config is:

username: root
password: <empty>

bd name : hidden
sql export of the db in th folder DB
made on wampserver 3.1.3

things that are not fixed:
-the user can like and "item" more than one time and it's added to the liked times page.
-the Apostrophe (') and special symbols are not escapted and cannot be added to the mysql db.

i'm not a very experienced in the organisation of my work but i hope that it will be easy for you to review. 
that's about all, thank you for reviewing this code, and feel free to contact me for any question.
